# CAL-Image-Processing
This ImageProcessing Orcc project contain the PDF documentation on low, medium and high level image processing algorithms in CAL.

A subset of the CAL packages were implemented as part of a Masters group project at Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: F21DG 2016-2017: Design and Code Project, "Image processing for CAL", which was supported by the EPSRC Rathlin project (EP/K009931/1).

The ImageProcessing Orcc code is online:

# CAL-Image-Processing
This ImageProcessing Orcc project contain the PDF documentation on low, medium and high level image processing algorithms in CAL.

A subset of the CAL packages were implemented as part of a Masters group project at Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: F21DG 2016-2017: Design and Code Project, "Image processing for CAL", which was supported by the EPSRC Rathlin project (EP/K009931/1).

The ImageProcessing Orcc code is online:

The other implementations were incoroporated from the existing RIP Orcc project.
    The low level algorithms are pixelwise operations and geometric image transforms.
    The medium level algorithms are connected components labelling, edge detection and texture analysis.
    The high level algorithm is a Histogram of Gradients (HOG) implementation, which can be connected to a support vector machine (SVM)                 for object detection as future work.
